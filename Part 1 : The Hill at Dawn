Alice paused at the crest of the hill, notebook in hand. The city below was quiet, but the puzzle ahead demanded attention.

She wrote a few cipher cryptic notes to herself:

- Hills often hold more than what meets the eye; sometimes they conceal patterns in plain sight.  
- Think in blocks, not just letters â€” small squares can reveal secrets when arranged properly.  
- Sequences of numbers matter, especially when read row by row.  

Alice smiled as she traced her finger across the page "wshusw.wwhT"

She wondered how she is going to find the key.

End of notes.
