# Border Game — Checkpoint #4

Fragments, receipts, and traces from the games I survived.
Each checkpoint is a marker on the path — follow carefully.

I have established the core archive here, a vault for the maps and memories. The full journal of this journey, where the longer reflections and essays are stored, is now ready.

Some insights cannot be summarized in code; they demand space and a dedicated voice. To find this complete journal, you must reassemble the full address from two critical traces I left scattered within this very archive!

Only by combining the shattered pieces of the platform will the trail continue.
