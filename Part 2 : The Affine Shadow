The sun barely broke over the horizon as Alice stepped into the abandoned library. Dust danced in the rays, and every book seemed to whisper fragments of secrets.

Her notes for this puzzle were careful:

- Some patterns shift in predictable ways, but a constant twist can completely change the meaning.  
- Multiplying effort by the right factor opens doors that addition alone cannot.  
- Pay attention to pairs of numbers; sometimes one controls the slope, the other the starting point.  
- Sequences that appear ordinary often hide transformations waiting to be discovered.  

Alice traced the notes for the text but couldnt find it.

Now where did it vanish?

End of notes.
